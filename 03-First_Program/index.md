# Let's start coding

## iNES header

The 16 byte iNES header gives the emulator all the information about the cart, including PRG/CHR bank sizes, mappers, mirroring... You can include all this inside your .asm's first lines:

```
  .inesprg 1  ; 1x 16Kb bank of PRG code
  .ineschr 1  ; 1x 8Kb bank of CHR data
  .inesmap 0  ; mapper 0 = NROM, no bank swapping
  .inesmir 1  ; Background mirroring (ignore for now)
```

## Banking

As we discussed earlier, the cart stores info in multiple banks. NESASM3 organizes everything in 8Kb code and 8Kb graphics banks. To fill the 16Kb PRG space 2 banks are needed. For each bank you'll have to use the `.org` directive to tell the assembler where to locate the code.

```
  .bank 0
  .org $C000
  ; Code here
  
  .bank 1
  .org $E000
  ; More code here
  
  .bank 2
  .org $0000
  ; Graphics here
```

## Including binary files

Additional data files are frequently used for graphics data or level data. The incbin directive can be used to include that data in your .nes file. This data isn't used right now, but it's needed to make the .nes file size match the iNES header.

```
  .bank 2
  .org $0000
  
  .incbin "mario.chr" ; Includes Super Mario Bros.' graphics
```
